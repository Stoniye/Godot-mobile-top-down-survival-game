I started this project at the beginning of the year 2023 but lost motivation after a few months. In total, I’ve put over 100 hours into this game. While my code is a bit messy, I figured I’d upload it—maybe someone will find it useful! If that’s you, feel free to reach out—I’d love to see what cool things you create. (Yea i know it's not the best game and does't look great, but it was one of my first attempts and it was fun :))

So far, I’ve implemented the following features:

  1. Saving and loading different worlds
  2. A shop system with openable chests
  3. Crafting
  4. Smelting using a furnace
  5. Building
  6. Traveling to other planets via rocket

I designed these systems to be as flexible as possible. In some cases, adding new features or content takes just a few seconds!

Here are some screenshots of the game:
